I plan to implement a communication bridge between Numato Labs 128 Channel USB GPIO and Digital Brushless DC Motor Driver 12V-48VDC using RS485 communication protocol.

The goal of this project is to provide total control over the Brushless DC motor and the computer that is connected.

In the end, I want fine control over RPM and torque
